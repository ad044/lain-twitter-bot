If you want to be free of suffering, you should believe in God.

Whether or not you believe in Him, God is always by your side.

Connect to Wired.

How could I turn something that did happen into something that didn't?

I don't know you. But you know me...

The flow of information doesn't always go both ways.

Since the moment of the Wired's creation, you have always been here.

Here, you are free.

I'm trying to tell you that that's not me!

How long have we been here, then?

If a being is remembered, that proves that it's part of a record!

You promised me earlier. That you'd go out with me.

You said you'd go out with me!

W-What're you talking about?

Did I?

You didn't! You didn't!

We're the same. I'm me. I'm the only me.

I don't know whether or not there's another me in the Wired. But there's definitely no other me here in the real world.

You only need to manipulate the memories of the people there, right?

Play track 44.

It's almost over, isn't it?

If I had installed this chip, what would've happened to me?

I said I don't know!

There's something strange about you. That's for sure.

The Knights are users who are fighting to make the only truth there is into a reality.

The truth has power because it's the truth. And because it's the truth, that makes it just.

Click, click... Memory check...

That's... That's me?

I'm you, so I wouldn't know.

This is a lie.

It's a lie. It's all a lie.

Why are you doing this?

The Earth's human population is approaching the number of neurons in the brain.

Douglas Rushkoff proposes that the consciousness of the Earth itself might be awakened when all humans on Earth become collectively networked.

The network's evolution would follow a neural model, and just as neurons within the human brain are connected by synapses, the Earth itself would become a neural network.

There is only one truth. God.

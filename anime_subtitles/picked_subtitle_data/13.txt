I... I'm confused again.

Am I here? Or am I there?

Over there, I'm everywhere. I know that.

I'm connected there, after all.

But where is the real me?

Oh, right. There is no real me.

I only exist inside those people who are aware of my existence.

But this me that's talking right now... It's me, isn't it?

This me that's talking... This me... Who is it?

I mess up everything I try to do for you, huh, Arisu?

I'm sorry...

I just thought of something strange.

If you don't remember something, it never happened.

If you aren't remembered, you never existed.

Present Day. Present Time.

Why are you crying?

But isn't that what you wanted?

No one hates you.

So Lain doesn't need to be anywhere anymore.

A network is a field to pass along information. Information doesn't stand still there. Information functions by always being in motion.

People's memories aren't just personal or one part of the history of humanity.

Do you think that humans could create something that could store memory that's that vast?

Do people really need to know that? Look at how far they've come without knowing.

The human world creates and prays to its various gods, and humans convince themselves, "This is how the world is."

Oh, right... Lain was never a person, was she?

Lain is omnipresent, existing everywhere.

Lain watches quietly.

Right, Lain is God!

It'd be so much easier if you became God.

No one would look down on Lain. No one would hate Lain.

Hey, Lain, let's start everything over again from the beginning!

Then what are you, Lain?

Where am I?

Come, Lain.

Everyone... You love them? Isn't that right?

Lain, I'll make us some nice tea next time. With some madeleines! Definitely. They're great!

So memories aren't only of the past, are they? They can be of right now, or even of tomorrow.

You're right. We can see each other anytime.

I'm here, so I'll be with you forever.

I'll tell you, but it's just between you and me.

I mean, the me in the Wired is... she's becoming less and less like me.

The real world and the Wired are attached end to end.

I can exist anywhere.

No matter where my body is, I can send my consciousness anywhere I want.

The real world isn't real at all.

Um... Thanks. Thanks for worrying about me.

That's what friends are for, right?

Lain? Who's that?

If you're going to play a game, can't you just do it over the Net?

The Wired and the real world are one and the same.

I... I don't want to be here. You understand that, don't you?

I'm breaking the barrier between the real world and the Wired.

Some say that the Wired doesn't have political borders like the real world. But there are far too many nonsense-spouting anarchists or idiots who think that pranks are a revolution.

Your presence in the Wired is highly unnatural.

Shut up, damn it...

Who cares about that crap? Like any of it matters...

If you're here without a device, you know that the border between the real world and the Wired is starting to crumble, don't you?

It's as she said. Something interesting is beginning.

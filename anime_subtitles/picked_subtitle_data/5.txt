If you can hear it, it is speaking to you.

Mankind is a creature that no longer evolves, is it not?

Not knowing what it is that drives them, they keep their bodies merely to satisfy the desires of the flesh.

It is no longer necessary to remain a wretched human being. Mankind has finally created an exit whereby he may escape.

There is nothing that you don't know.

I can't tell you a story that doesn't exist.

An event first comes into existence when there is a prophecy.

The other side is overcrowded. The dead will have no place to go.

History is not merely a linear collection of points that we pass through on a timeline.

By who? Who connects them?

Knights? Who's that?

Some kind of super-hacker group.

This is because the body, the activity of the human brain, is merely a physical phenomenon caused by synapses delivering electrical impulses.

The body exists only to verify one's own existence.

Fulfill the prophecy!

Come on, I know you're there.

It may be that what flows through the Wired isn't merely electrical information.

If we assume that it was the development of electricity and phones that brought about the formation of the Wired, then I have to wonder if another world was created at that moment.

Here in the real world, God exists only as a concept. But in the Wired, there may be a sort of Deus-like embodiment.

God?

I think I may have talked with God.

It's possible that the Deus of the Wired may already have enough power to affect the real world in some instances.

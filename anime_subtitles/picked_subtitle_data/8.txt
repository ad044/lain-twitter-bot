Do you want to be hurt, too?

Do you want your heart to feel like it's being scraped with a rasp?

It doesn't matter to the user if God exists in the Wired.

What's so fun about this? All you do is kill other players.

Nobody knows what's fun and why.

Do you know how we're able to exchange information in the Wired like this?

The 7th-gen protocol...

It's funny, isn't it? People say the funniest things, huh?

Shut up! Who cares about any of that?

Don't you find it interesting?

Who's there?

You're looking for me, aren't you?

How do you define "God"?

Where are you?

I am you.

You must have realized that another you has always existed in the Wired.

You are merely a hologram of that other you. You are just a body.

You expect me to believe that?

That's impossible. It's crazy.

But you don't think that the you in the real world is the same as the one standing here in the Wired, do you?

What did I do? What did I do in the Wired?

What's the other me doing?

You're not me.

Why? Why are you warm?

Why do I have to feel your body heat?

Hey, I'm Lain, aren't I?

You're the same as me.

You're omnipresent in the Wired.

Wherever anyone is, wherever they go, you have always been there.

You've watched what they didn't want others to see.

The Wired's information should be shared, shouldn't it?

Everything you say is a lie.

You're telling me that these dupes are me?

Their memories of being seen by Lain... I could delete that information!

Hey, I wanna go to Cyberia today!

That's right! Lain is Lain, and I'm me.

Hello, Navi.

I... I'm me, right?

There's no other me but me, right?

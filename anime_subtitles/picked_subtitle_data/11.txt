No, it's nothing as ambiguous as "memory"

Am I me?

Lain is Lain

I wish you'd come here...

I don't need to stay here.

I've never seen one before!

I've seen you before. In the Wired.

Come.

Hey, I'm Lain, aren't I?

That's right, Lain. You're not needed in the real world.

I'm committing suicide!

Why? Why are you warm?

Lain, you'd have more fun if you were a little more sociable.

Are you tired?

It's dangerous to subject yourself to that much information all at once.

Am I a machine?

Don't talk about me like I'm a machine.

Lain, you're software.

Be quiet... be quiet!

I understand. I finally understand what you told me.

It's easy to die, Lain.

There's nothing easy about dying.

Bodies are meaningless.

W-Who's there?

It looks like I'm not the only me.

But no matter how often I say I didn't do it, you'll believe that I did.

I'll make it so that it never happened.

It looks like I've already destroyed the border between the Wired and the real world.

I can go anyplace I want to now.

I'm scared...

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,590
<font face="Bembo Std Semibold" size="54" color="#c21411">Present Time</font>

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,340
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And you don't seem to understand</font>

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,540
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}A shame you seemed an honest man</font>

5
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:32,290
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And all the fears you hold so dear</font>

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,560
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}Will turn to whisper in your ear</font>

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,960
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And you know what they say might hurt you</font>

8
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,430
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}And you know that it means so much</font>

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,190
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And you don't even feel a thing</font>

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,850
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}I am falling, I am fading</font>

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,970
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}I have lost it all</font>

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:25,990
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning</font>

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,630
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}Help me to breathe</font>

14
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:33,840
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}I am hurting, I have lost it all</font>

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,380
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}I am losing</font>

16
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,580
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}Help me to breathe</font>

17
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">There is only one truth. God.</font>

18
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yes. Me.</font>

19
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Isn't that right, Lain?</font>

20
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're God?</font>

21
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yes. I am God.</font>

22
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why are you God? I don't understand.</font>

23
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're dead, aren't you? A dead human.</font>

24
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,200
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Somebody like that can't be God, can they?</font>

25
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I realized that I had no need for a body.</font>

26
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,590
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">To die is merely to abandon the flesh.</font>

27
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's... That's just what Chisa said.</font>

28
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,530
<font face="Inkburrow" size="45">I don't need to stay here.</font>

29
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,990
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I suppose she did, at that.</font>

30
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,980
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I caused the protocol that governs the Wired to evolve.</font>

31
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,610
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yeah. That's what you did.</font>

32
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,990
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But a protocol is just an agreement.</font>

33
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:36,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yes, but I incorporated code that operates on a higher phase.</font>

34
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">So?</font>

35
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">There is compressed information mixed into the protocol.</font>

36
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,220
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What kind of information?</font>

37
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Human memories. Mine.</font>

38
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,770
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The thoughts, history, memories, and emotions of the man named Eiri Masami.</font>

39
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What does that mean?</font>

40
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,560
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I can live forever as an anonymous entity in the Wired,</font>

41
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">and will be able to rule it with information.</font>

42
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What do you think a being like that should be called?</font>

43
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,710
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A god.</font>

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,870
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">There is no God.</font>

45
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,200
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yes. Even if I were an omnipresent being and could influence others,</font>

46
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">with no one to worship me, I am no god.</font>

47
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,640
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But you had them. Or made them, I should say.</font>

48
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Knights.</font>

49
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You no longer need a body, Lain.</font>

50
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,840
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's a lie!</font>

51
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,850
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Talk about lame!</font>

52
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,900
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Some people are like that, I guess.</font>

53
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">So I said, go ahead and do it.</font>

54
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,840
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Anyway...</font>

55
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,700
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, look at this!</font>

56
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,840
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Isn't it cute?</font>

57
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,180
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It was really cheap!</font>

58
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,980
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">At that place next door?</font>

59
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yeah, over there!</font>

60
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Let's go, let's go!</font>

61
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sure, we don't have anything after school today.</font>

62
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, you're right.</font>

63
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,350
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Let's go!</font>

64
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,900
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Stand!</font>

65
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,830
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Bow!</font>

66
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">All right, close your books.</font>

67
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,700
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I... I'm real!</font>

68
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,820
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm alive!</font>

69
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,150
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm here.</font>

70
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why is this happening?</font>

71
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Was it something I did?</font>

72
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I always tried to keep something like this from happening.</font>

73
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I always tried not to say anything weird.</font>

74
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,600
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Can it be true?</font>

75
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm not supposed to have a body?</font>

76
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,550
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's right, Lain.</font>

77
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're not needed in the real world.</font>

78
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm home.</font>

79
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Dad?</font>

80
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,420
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">This is goodbye, Miss Lain.</font>

81
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,960
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You must have figured it out by now. Our work here is finished.</font>

82
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,850
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It was only for a short time, but I know I didn't do enough for you.</font>

83
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,210
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're now free to become anything you want.</font>

84
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No, you were free all along.</font>

85
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I wasn't given permission to say goodbye, but I loved you.</font>

86
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,630
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's not that I enjoyed playing house...</font>

87
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Maybe I envied a being like you.</font>

88
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Goodbye.</font>

89
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,010
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Wait!</font>

90
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,020
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Don't leave me alone!</font>

91
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,850
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Alone? You're not alone.</font>

92
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,030
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If you connect to the Wired, everyone will welcome you.</font>

93
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's the sort of being you were.</font>

94
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,340
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm not alone.</font>

95
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,110
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Do you want to do anything, Lain?</font>

96
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,020
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">This is your world, Lain.</font>

97
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who are the Knights? They're the ones who made the fake me, right?</font>

98
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm not sure.</font>

99
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,330
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No, it's possible.</font>

100
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">They say you can trace the origin of the</font>

101
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Knights of the Eastern Calculus back to the Knights Templar.</font>

102
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:11,110
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">They've used that invisible human network, the collective unconscious,</font>

103
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,350
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">since long before the Wired was born.</font>

104
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What do you want to do, Lain?</font>

105
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,080
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Knights...</font>

106
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,080
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who are the Knights?</font>

107
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,320
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You really want to know, don't you, Lain?</font>

108
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,880
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Wired's God is a god because He has worshipers.</font>

109
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,490
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, Taro, let's go someplace else.</font>

110
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,890
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">This place has gotten boring.</font>

111
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,760
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yeah. Why not come over to my house?</font>

112
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You don't need to come, Masayuki.</font>

113
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,520
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's the big idea?</font>

114
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,070
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Taro says he doesn't wanna hang out with a little kid like you.</font>

115
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,830
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Wha...?</font>

116
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,270
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're as much a kid as I am, Myu-Myu!</font>

117
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,340
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's okay for a girl! Everybody knows that younger is better for girls.</font>

118
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,980
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Right, Taro?</font>

119
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,750
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's that?</font>

120
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,020
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's up, Taro? Is there something on the Net News?</font>

121
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,930
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's a list.</font>

122
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,850
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Huh? What kind of list?</font>

123
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,320
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's a list of Knights members doing on the Net News?</font>

124
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Y-Yes?</font>

125
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,130
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Please remain silent.</font>

126
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-Who are you?</font>

127
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,200
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Time to pay the piper, all right?</font>

128
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,530
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-What do you mean?</font>

129
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Mom, I got killed!</font>

130
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Mom!</font>

131
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's your turn, Mom! If you don't hurry up, I'm gonna keep playing!</font>

132
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,680
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Okay, Mom?</font>

133
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,710
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm gonna take 'em out!</font>

134
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A series of suicides occurred today all over the world,</font>

135
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">and each country's Information Control Ministry</font>

136
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">and police departments have begun investigating the cause.</font>

137
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,400
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Each victim was involved in network-related work,</font>

138
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">and sources tell us that it appears that they were all members</font>

139
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,370
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">of a fraternal order known as the "Knights."</font>

140
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why did you do it?</font>

141
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It was a request from our client.</font>

142
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You hunted down all the Knights in the world.</font>

143
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,360
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Our associates are now on their way to dispose of them.</font>

144
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But why?</font>

145
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Wired can't be allowed to be a special world.</font>

146
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,830
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It can only be a field that functions as a sub-system reinforcing the real world.</font>

147
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,080
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But still...</font>

148
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You can't be allowed to exist in the Wired, either.</font>

149
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,420
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But here you are, safe and sound.</font>

150
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,490
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Some god or whatever must be protecting you.</font>

151
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Eiri Masami's residual thought program</font>

152
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">will eventually be disinfected from the Wired.</font>

153
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:19,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Our client is working on a total rewrite of the Protocol Seven code.</font>

154
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">We have no need for gods.</font>

155
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Right. Not in the Wired or in the real world.</font>

156
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:50,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">We still haven't figured out what you are.</font>

157
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,940
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But I love you.</font>

158
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Love certainly is a strange emotion, isn't it?</font>

159
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What will you do?</font>

160
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,890
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Well, let me think...</font>

161
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,800
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You don't have anyone to pray to you now.</font>

162
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:54,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I can't be a god, then. But I haven't lost all of them.</font>

163
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,130
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If only one believer remains, I can still be a god.</font>

164
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,340
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who?</font>

165
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,800
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Come, now... You, Lain.</font>

166
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's because of me that you can stay yourself.</font>

167
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You were originally born in the Wired.</font>

168
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The legend of the Wired. The heroine of the Wired's fairy tales.</font>

169
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,640
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Liar.</font>

170
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,880
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The real world's Iwakura Lain is merely a hologram of her.</font>

171
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A homunculus of artificial ribosomes.</font>

172
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,580
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You never had a body to begin with.</font>

173
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,590
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's a lie.</font>

174
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A fake family. Fake friends. Yes, it was all a lie.</font>

175
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,900
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's a lie...</font>

176
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's all a lie...</font>

177
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,740
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Poor Lain... She's all alone.</font>

178
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But I'm here. The man who loves you is here.</font>

179
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:17,550
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You should be able to love me, the man who sent you to this world...</font>

180
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,380
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I am your creator.</font>

181
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,380
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Love me.</font>

182
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,730
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">All right, Lain?</font>

183
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The other...</font>

184
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,880
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The other me, she's...</font>

185
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That isn't another you. It's the real you.</font>

186
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Like it matters!</font>

187
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,580
<font face="Bembo Std Semibold" size="35">{\an8}nan no tsumi mo nai hazu na no ni</font>

192
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,790
<font face="Bembo Std Semibold" size="35">I wasn't the one who sowed those seeds, but nevertheless</font>

196
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,890

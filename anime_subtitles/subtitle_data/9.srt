21
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Conjecture has become fact, and rumor has become history.</font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">In 1984, a manila envelope arrived at the home of TV producer Jaime Shandera.</font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The envelope, from an anonymous source, contained a roll of undeveloped film.</font>

25
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The film contained what is called the MJ-12 Document.</font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Roscoe Hillenkoetter, head of the CIA at the time of the Roswell Incident,</font>

31
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,650
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">was in fact copied carefully from another document.</font>

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I suppose.</font>

44
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,770
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">How long have we been here, then?</font>

45
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,130
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">At the very least, we cannot have been here since this world was created.</font>

46
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That has nothing to do with it!</font>

47
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If a being is remembered, that proves that it's part of a record!</font>

48
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,870
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's preposterous.</font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The MEMEX memory expansion concept unveiled by Vannevar Bush in 1945</font>

52
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,850

53
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">was projected onto a translucent screen.</font>

54
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What he envisioned was the compression and rapid access of information.</font>

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,670
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Even before the advent of computers,</font>

56
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Bush had already created the basis for our current multimedia</font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If you don't need it, I'll toss it.</font>

61
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I left that here?</font>

62
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's what I'm sayin'.</font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What?</font>

73
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You promised me earlier.</font>

74
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Promised what?</font>

75
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,560
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That you'd go out with me.</font>

76
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,070
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You said you'd go out with me!</font>

77
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-What're you talking about?</font>

78
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,770
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Taro, is that true?</font>

79
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,010
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Did I?</font>

80
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You didn't! You didn't!</font>

81
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:47,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Even if I did, you aren't the you I want to go out with right now, Lain.</font>

82
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,590
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Taro, you moron!</font>

83
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">We're the same. I'm me. I'm the only me.</font>

84
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,950
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Awesome!</font>

85
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,900
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I can't believe you put together something like this!</font>

86
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,660
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Oh, okay! This syncs up the parallel processors!</font>

87
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,600
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's not pretty, but you can keep on expanding it this way.</font>

88
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What're you using as coolant?</font>

89
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Taro...</font>

90
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,010
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Is this liquid carbon?</font>

91
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sit down over there.</font>

92
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,170
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Damn...</font>

93
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,510
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I think you know what this is.</font>

94
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,150
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's you, isn't it, Taro?</font>

95
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,650
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're with the Knights, aren't you?</font>

96
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,580
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're... the real Lain.</font>

97
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,080
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I don't know whether or not there's another me in the Wired.</font>

98
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But there's definitely no other me here in the real world.</font>

99
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,220
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The other one with a body has only appeared in the club.</font>

100
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You only need to manipulate the memories of the people there, right?</font>

101
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,030
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I... I can't...</font>

102
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Play track 44.</font>

103
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's almost over, isn't it?</font>

104
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,830
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Finally.</font>

105
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,730
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">So while we still can, we should...</font>

106
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Roger.</font>

107
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Now communicating.</font>

108
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Stop.</font>

109
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's not me!</font>

110
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,150
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But I knew the data coming into JJ's place had this kind of effect.</font>

111
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,070
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If I had installed this chip, what would've happened to me?</font>

112
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:32,350
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Would I have killed myself? Gone insane?</font>

113
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I said I don't know!</font>

114
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,380
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">There's no way a kid like me could be a formal Knights member!</font>

115
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,320
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm just a...</font>

116
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,020
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I wonder what this will do?</font>

117
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:49,610
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I-It's non-volatile memory! It'll overwrite existing memories!</font>

118
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What kind of memories?</font>

119
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I-I don't know.</font>

120
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,870
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Knights aren't just ordinary crackers, Lain.</font>

121
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">There's something strange about you. That's for sure.</font>

122
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's why the Knights are so interested.</font>

123
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Knights are users who are fighting</font>

124
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,710
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">to make the only truth there is into a reality.</font>

125
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,010
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I don't understand. What do you mean, "one truth"?</font>

126
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,070
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Like I said, I'm not a formal Knights member.</font>

127
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,370
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">They never explained it to me.</font>

128
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:44,710
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But it's true. The truth has power because it's the truth.</font>

129
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">And because it's the truth, that makes it just.</font>

130
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,960
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's persuasive, isn't it? Don't you want truth like that?</font>

00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm going.</font>

132
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,700
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Myu-Myu is jealous of you.</font>

133
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Taro? Thank you.</font>

134
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,770
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You...</font>

135
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:27,790
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, this is a date, you know? I'm a guy. I had to do that.</font>

136
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Ted Nelson, who studied under the two cult pioneers</font>

137
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Vannevar Bush and John C. Lilly,</font>

138
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:52,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">proposed a giant electronic library in satellites in stationary orbit</font>

139
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,990
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">which could be used at any terminal on Earth via radio or phone lines.</font>

140
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:03,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">He called this concept that would make this database "Xanadu."</font>

141
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,270
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Mongolian utopia where all written cultures would never be lost.</font>

142
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">This was Xanadu.</font>

143
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,940
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It was the concept of Hypertext that would make it real,</font>

144
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,350
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">and Ted Nelson's name would go down in history as its originator.</font>

145
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hello, Navi.</font>

146
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,540
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Click, click... Memory check...</font>

147
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,770
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Click, click...</font>

148
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,640
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Click, click...</font>

149
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,890
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's... That's me?</font>

150
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yes. This is me.</font>

151
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,490
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Then who are they?</font>

152
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm you, so I wouldn't know.</font>

153
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,010
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">This is a lie.</font>

154
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,320
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's a lie. It's all a lie.</font>

155
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,880
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why are you doing this?</font>

156
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:13,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Earth has its own specific electromagnetic waves.</font>

157
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,930
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Between the ionosphere and the Earth's surface,</font>

158
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:22,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">there is a constant resonance at a frequency of 8Hz in the ELF band.</font>

159
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,200
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">This is called the Schumann Resonance.</font>

160
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,110
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The extent of the effect on humans of these "Earth Brain Waves"</font>

161
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,380
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">that the planet constantly gives off remains unknown.</font>

162
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Earth's human population is approaching</font>

163
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">the number of neurons in the brain.</font>

164
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:53,130
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Douglas Rushkoff proposes that the consciousness of the Earth itself</font>

165
00:19:53,130 --> 00:20:00,210
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">might be awakened when all humans on Earth become collectively networked.</font>

166
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,240
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The network's evolution would follow a neural model,</font>

167
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,110
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">and just as neurons within the human brain are connected by synapses,</font>

168
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">the Earth itself would become a neural network.</font>

169
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,220
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">There is only one truth. God.</font>

170
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,370
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yes. Me.</font>

171
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,130
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Eiri Masami, Chief Researcher at Tachibana General Labs,</font>

172
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">further developed the hypothesis of a worldwide neural network.</font>

173
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,400
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">His hypothesis proposed a wireless network whereby all humanity</font>

174
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">would be plugged in at an unconscious level without the need for any device.</font>

175
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Furthermore, he encoded the Schumann Resonance Factor</font>

176
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:19,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">and inserted it into the 7th-gen Wired Protocol on his own initiative.</font>

177
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,320
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Upon discovering this, Tachibana General Labs dismissed Eiri.</font>

178
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,730
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">One week later, Eiri Masami's body was found on the Yamanote train line.</font>

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,540
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}A shame you seemed an honest man</font>

5
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:32,290
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And all the fears you hold so dear</font>

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,560
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}Will turn to whisper in your ear</font>

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,960
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And you know what they say might hurt you</font>

8
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,430
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}And you know that it means so much</font>

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,190
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And you don't even feel a thing</font>

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,630
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}Help me to breathe</font>

14
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:33,840
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}I am hurting, I have lost it all</font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You've heard of a girl named Lain, right?</font>

18
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,830
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain of the Wired.</font>

19
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,960
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Are your parents away on vacation or something?</font>

20
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I called the number you gave me, but no one answered.</font>

21
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,220
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm not lying.</font>

22
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No, I don't think you're lying. I checked.</font>

23
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're Iwakura Lain, all right.</font>

24
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Your address and phone number check out.</font>

25
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,380
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's late, so I'm going to have someone take you home.</font>

26
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,210
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But next time, I want you to talk to me.</font>

27
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Keeping quiet is a bad idea, even if you weren't involved.</font>

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,740
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">For crying out loud...</font>

29
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,920
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain, I'm sorry!</font>

30
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">This is all our fault. Are you okay, Lain?</font>

31
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,330
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Are you all right, Lain?</font>

32
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A...</font>

33
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What is it, Lain?</font>

34
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,270
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A... ri... su.</font>

35
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,070
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu! Come on! We're going home.</font>

36
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain...</font>

37
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu!</font>

38
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,550
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Lain...</font>

39
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Tomorrow... Let's talk tomorrow, okay?</font>

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,370
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm sorry!</font>

41
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,850
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">So do you want to head home, too?</font>

42
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,380
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A... risu.</font>

43
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You have a key, right?</font>

44
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yes.</font>

45
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Message...</font>

46
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,890
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">There are no messages for Lain.</font>

47
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,200
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Good night, Navi.</font>

48
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,600
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Good night, Lain.</font>

49
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Don't you think it's embarrassing for a junior high-schooler</font>

50
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,900
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">to oversleep and be late for school?</font>

51
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,790
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Mom, about last night...</font>

52
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,960
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hm? What about it?</font>

53
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,460
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Never mind.</font>

54
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,190
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain.</font>

55
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain.</font>

56
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,330
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain.</font>

57
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,070
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's me, Lain. You can hear me, can't you?</font>

58
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who's there?</font>

59
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,870
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You are not alone.</font>

60
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">'Morning!</font>

61
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Good morning!</font>

62
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,630
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Oh, my god!</font>

63
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,700
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Was he cute?</font>

64
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yeah, they wouldn't show his face on TV!</font>

65
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Well...</font>

66
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,640
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Oh, you were screaming the whole time. Did you even see his face?</font>

67
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,600
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Well, yeah, but...</font>

68
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I was a little...</font>

69
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You were too scared to look.</font>

70
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain!</font>

71
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain, did you get in trouble yesterday?</font>

72
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Come on, it wasn't really our fault.</font>

73
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm sorry. I'll be right back.</font>

74
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,530
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Right, Arisu was closest to the guy!</font>

75
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">So, was there blood splattered all over?</font>

76
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,070
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yeah...</font>

77
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,770
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Tell them!</font>

78
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Come on!</font>

79
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,640
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu!</font>

80
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,010
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But that's not all.</font>

81
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:27,010
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If you look at the Psyche as a mere processor, you lose sight of the whole.</font>

82
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">As a multi-purpose information terminal,</font>

83
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,630
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">the Navi has come into wide use even among grade-schoolers.</font>

84
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,070
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">However, activity within the Wired is currently limited by the machine.</font>

85
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,400
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Psyche can dramatically increase the performance of any Navi.</font>

86
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">There was no reason for me to stay in the real world any longer.</font>

87
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,200
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">In the real world, it didn't matter if I was there or not.</font>

88
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">When I realized that, I was no longer afraid of losing my body.</font>

89
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,890
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who is Lain?</font>

90
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Huh?</font>

91
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,920
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who is Lain?</font>

92
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who is Lain?</font>

93
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who is Lain?</font>

94
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,530
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">There's something wrong with us!</font>

95
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,080
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">We saw someone die right in front of us yesterday,</font>

96
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,510
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">but we're acting like it's something we saw in a movie.</font>

97
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:33,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I know we were there last night, but it didn't seem real.</font>

98
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I guess it's like that for me, too.</font>

99
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I don't think you should take it so seriously, Arisu.</font>

100
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No, that's not what I mean.</font>

101
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm saying it's strange that we can't take it seriously.</font>

102
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Right, Lain?</font>

103
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Huh? What?</font>

104
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,540
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's that, a love letter?</font>

105
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,350
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No way!</font>

106
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,360
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">N-No! I don't think it is, anyway...</font>

107
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,940
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Let us see! Let us see!</font>

108
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Come on, don't be stingy! Show us!</font>

109
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Stop that! It's mean!</font>

110
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,990
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A brown paper envelope, huh?</font>

111
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's written on it?</font>

112
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Huh?</font>

113
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,760
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What the heck is this?</font>

114
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Talk about boring!</font>

115
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I knew it.</font>

116
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,490
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Psyche...</font>

117
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,740
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You've got it all wrong! Somebody peeped into my voice mail!</font>

118
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I can't believe it!</font>

119
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">As the relevant clauses were not in the resume we received,</font>

120
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:25,680
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">we are currently discussing how to handle it. As for your company...</font>

121
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,320
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I love kissing. Just kissing is enough to make me happy.</font>

122
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You heard about that kid pulling a stupid stunt on Accela, right?</font>

123
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,070
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Looks like the black market supplier is freaking out.</font>

124
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You can't find it anywhere now.</font>

125
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Rumor has it that the Psyche chip is mass-produced in factories in Taiwan.</font>

126
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,610
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Rumor also says that it was designed by a group called the Knights.</font>

127
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But I'm not sure if these "Knights" even exist.</font>

128
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">In the Wired, there are a lot of urban legends like that.</font>

129
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,190
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Dying feels so good!</font>

130
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,420
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I feel accelerated...</font>

131
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What the...? There's someone in my room!</font>

132
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,610
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's a little person like a kid in a red and green striped shirt!</font>

133
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:17,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I can't move in my bed! It's standing by my door, watching me!</font>

134
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Help me!</font>

135
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I have a picture of you with your secret lover.</font>

136
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,190
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I just want to do business. What do you say?</font>

137
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,350
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If you don't buy it, I'll leak this image data to your company's server.</font>

138
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You'll be famous all over the Wired.</font>

139
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain, why won't you come here?</font>

140
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,210
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain has new mail.</font>

141
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Navi...</font>

142
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,650
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">How's it going, Lain?</font>

143
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,370
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Gotten used to your new Navi?</font>

144
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,210
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Something wrong?</font>

145
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,960
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Do you know what this is?</font>

146
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No.</font>

147
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I thought...</font>

148
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I thought you'd know, Dad.</font>

149
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,880
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I said I don't know.</font>

150
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Come on, why not?</font>

151
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No... I can't...</font>

152
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,080
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why not? I love you.</font>

153
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,940
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain!</font>

154
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Where've you been lately? I haven't seen you around.</font>

155
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,080
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I...</font>

156
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,560
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What the...? Damn, you're sure going for the "little girl" look today...</font>

157
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Let's have another rave, okay? I'll leave the planning to you.</font>

158
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,890
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why're you trying to act so tough?</font>

159
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,890
Excuse me.

160
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,550
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Look who's talking!</font>

161
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,350
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Do you know what this is?</font>

162
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I-Is that a Psyche?!</font>

163
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,270
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Wha...</font>

164
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No way!</font>

165
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,370
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I've never seen one before!</font>

166
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-Where did you buy it?</font>

167
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,360
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You know what this is?</font>

168
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What're you saying?</font>

169
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,370
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">With that installed, I could get full access to the Wired with even this!</font>

170
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,540
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">How do you use it?</font>

171
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Talk about lame! You don't even know that?</font>

172
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,050
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Can I buy it off you? Can I?</font>

173
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,660
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Moron! Like you could buy something like that!</font>

174
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What kind of Navi do you have?</font>

175
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm not really sure. It's a Tachibana.</font>

176
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,530
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Their newest model, I think.</font>

177
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Awesome!</font>

178
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,540
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Have you gotten inside it?</font>

179
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,890
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You in eighth grade? Ninth?</font>

180
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,700
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Eighth.</font>

181
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,490
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Then you've taken Basic Information, right?</font>

182
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,590
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A Navi's basic motherboard layout is in the textbook.</font>

183
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You connect it to the board, opposite the main processor.</font>

184
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,710
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It intercepts the original data and manipulates it on its own.</font>

185
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,210
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Using it is easier than building a model kit.</font>

186
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You just need to watch out for static electricity.</font>

187
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Oh. Thanks.</font>

188
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,610
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hold it!</font>

189
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,750
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Information isn't free, not in the Wired or in the real world.</font>

190
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,730
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">How much you gonna charge? How much?</font>

191
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,760
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Uh...</font>

192
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,490
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're Lain, aren't you?</font>

193
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:11,790
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I saw you once. In the Wired.</font>

194
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You saw me? In the Wired?</font>

195
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,770
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You were totally different then than you are now.</font>

196
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,050
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Most people take on a personality in the Wired</font>

197
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,750
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">that's different than what they have in the real world,</font>

198
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">but yours are total opposites.</font>

199
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,680
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No way!</font>

200
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,650
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You were here when that idiot started shooting, too, weren't you?</font>

201
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,920
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What are you planning?</font>

202
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,110
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What... What should I do for you?</font>

203
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,170
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Go out on a date with me!</font>

204
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:46,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Moron.</font>

205
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,200
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But not like you are now.</font>

206
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,750
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I want the wild Lain.</font>

207
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,540
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I-I'm just kidding!</font>

208
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But if you feel like it sometime...</font>

209
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,850
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What're you talking about?!</font>

210
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,190
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey...</font>

211
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Forget about it! Let's go!</font>

212
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sure!</font>

213
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's so great about you?</font>

214
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,450
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Uh... Excuse me?</font>

215
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,710
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Are you here to see someone?</font>

216
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,740
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who are you?</font>

217
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,840
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You never saw us.</font>

218
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-What? I'll call the police!</font>

219
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,900
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">We're not here, you see.</font>

220
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,370
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">H-Hey...</font>

221
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-What the hell?</font>

222
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,320
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Mom, if they show up again, call the cops!</font>

223
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,760
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Are you listening, Mom?</font>

224
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,020
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Damn it...</font>

225
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,520
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-What're you doing, Lain?</font>

226
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What are you doing? Why are you dressed like that?</font>

227
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,740
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Well, I heard that you have to watch out for static electricity.</font>

228
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,890
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">So I thought it'd probably be safest if I took off my clothes.</font>

229
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A-Are you kidding?</font>

230
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Welcome home, sis!</font>

231

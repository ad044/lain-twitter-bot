00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,590
<font face="Bembo Std Semibold" size="54" color="#c21411">Present Time</font>

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,340
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And you don't seem to understand</font>

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,540
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}A shame you seemed an honest man</font>

5
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:32,290
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And all the fears you hold so dear</font>

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,560
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}Will turn to whisper in your ear</font>

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,960
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And you know what they say might hurt you</font>

8
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,430
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}And you know that it means so much</font>

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,190
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And you don't even feel a thing</font>

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,850
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}I am falling, I am fading</font>

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,970
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}I have lost it all</font>

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:25,990
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning</font>

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,630
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}Help me to breathe</font>

14
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:33,840
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}I am hurting, I have lost it all</font>

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,380
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}I am losing</font>

16
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,580
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}Help me to breathe</font>

17
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,270
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I don't need parents. Humans are all alone.</font>

18
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">They're not connected to anyone at all.</font>

19
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,340
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">How did it go?</font>

20
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain's acting funny.</font>

21
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's nothing new, but still...</font>

22
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No, it's perfectly normal.</font>

23
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,770
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Huh? What're you talking about?</font>

24
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,610
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Mika, watch your tone with your father.</font>

25
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,660
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Is she right?</font>

26
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yes.</font>

27
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,460
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Shit! Shit!</font>

28
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,560
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Shit!</font>

29
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Shit! Shit!</font>

30
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,660
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What do you want?!</font>

31
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,450
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's going on?!</font>

32
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,080
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Shit!</font>

33
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,920
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">SHIT!</font>

34
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Gotcha.</font>

35
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,360
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">We have homeroom next hour, right? Is that lucky, or what?</font>

36
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,830
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Don't you think it's strange that they called a special staff meeting?</font>

37
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Do you think it's true, then?</font>

38
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What?</font>

39
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,710
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">They say a high school senior committed suicide.</font>

40
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">S-Suicide?</font>

41
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's not just at our school, either.</font>

42
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Somebody jumped off the roof of their apartment building a while ago, too.</font>

43
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,640
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, Lain.</font>

44
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,890
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sorry. What is it?</font>

45
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,650
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I guess Lain wouldn't know anything about it...</font>

46
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The suicide, you mean?</font>

47
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,490
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You know about that?</font>

48
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,740
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Really?</font>

49
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I've just heard a little about it, that's all.</font>

50
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Where?</font>

51
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Wired.</font>

52
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,130
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Right, you must've gotten the hang of your new Navi by now.</font>

53
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,880
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You'll have to show it to me sometime.</font>

54
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sure. But I'm modifying it a little right now.</font>

55
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,640
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Modifying it? I didn't know you were into that hacking stuff.</font>

56
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,180
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You know, you've changed lately.</font>

57
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,350
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Really? You think so?</font>

58
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,940
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">She has?</font>

59
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,360
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yeah. I can't put my finger on it.</font>

60
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">So, what sort of rumors have you heard in the Wired?</font>

61
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,660
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Well... That's it's some kind of game.</font>

62
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,660
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A game? A network game, you mean?</font>

63
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,170
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I don't really know. I don't play those.</font>

64
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:14,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But they say that all the dead kids were hooked on it.</font>

65
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,180
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Guys sure like that stuff...</font>

66
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,600
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A game, huh? But why?</font>

67
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,760
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I...</font>

68
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,980
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, don't wolf down food like that! You'll choke!</font>

69
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,270
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm okay.</font>

70
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,320
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You mind if I go home?</font>

71
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, you don't need to ask our permission or anything.</font>

72
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,570
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You have plans?</font>

73
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,700
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I want to get home and put my Navi back together.</font>

74
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,580
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's still in bits and pieces.</font>

75
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You prefer a machine to your friends, huh?</font>

76
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,080
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Cut it out, Juri! Don't talk like that!</font>

77
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,210
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm not accusing her of anything.</font>

78
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Once you're done, you'll have to show us, Lain.</font>

79
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,670
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sure.</font>

80
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,010
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sorry.</font>

81
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">She has changed.</font>

82
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,770
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm sorry!</font>

83
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Here.</font>

84
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,450
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No, it was my fault.</font>

85
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,580
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sorry!</font>

86
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,130
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Log in. Lain.</font>

87
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Authorized.</font>

88
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Mail.</font>

89
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Voice mail.</font>

90
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,570
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hello, Lain.</font>

91
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I couldn't figure out the answer to your question by myself,</font>

92
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,490
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">so I asked a colleague at the lab about it.</font>

93
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If that really is a Psyche processor that you have,</font>

94
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,710
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">then you should probably set the oscillation to "variable" like you thought.</font>

95
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Navi motherboards are designed to work with just about anything,</font>

96
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,680
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">but you might run into some glitches.</font>

97
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,850
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Good luck.</font>

98
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If you need anything else, just ask.</font>

99
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,240
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">JJ!</font>

100
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,320
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yeah?</font>

101
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,020
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You know anything about that net game that all the kids are playing?</font>

102
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,130
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Oh, you mean Phantoma?</font>

103
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,590
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Forget about it. An adult like you wouldn't be into that.</font>

104
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,050
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Right, Lain?</font>

105
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No way...</font>

106
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Damn, are my ears playing tricks on me already?</font>

107
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I... I quit already!</font>

108
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,850
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Leave me out of it!</font>

109
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,700
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">This isn't the Wired!</font>

110
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,540
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why? Why is this happening?!</font>

111
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,710
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Wait, don't run.</font>

112
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,130
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who are you?!</font>

113
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,680
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Are you a PK, too? Help me!</font>

114
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I can't go where you are.</font>

115
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's going on?!</font>

116
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,870
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Stop screwing around!</font>

117
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,010
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Bullet charge! Gauge 5!</font>

118
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,510
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

119
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

120
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,600
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

121
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

122
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,940
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

123
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,980
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

124
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

125
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,580
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

126
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,610
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

127
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

128
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,110
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

129
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

130
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

131
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,570
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Die!</font>

132
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I was scared, that's all.</font>

133
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:33,170
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I didn't know it was just a little girl. It's not my fault.</font>

134
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,450
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I didn't even know her.</font>

135
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,340
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Phantoma is a game with a dedicated client application</font>

136
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">that lets you fight in the Wired.</font>

137
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:52,950
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I downloaded the app from an illegal server to play it a little while ago.</font>

138
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:59,490
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">For us, it had a dungeon-style action game interface,</font>

139
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,130
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">but I guess it had somehow gotten linked</font>

140
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,200
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">to a tag game played by kindergartners.</font>

141
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,610
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You have mail.</font>

142
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Open it.</font>

143
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,080
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, Lain. I didn't know you were into stuff like Phantoma.</font>

144
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I checked around, but didn't find out much.</font>

145
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,550
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Anyway, the basic game isn't all that unusual in the Wired,</font>

146
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">so my guess is that they just modified that.</font>

147
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,350
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The problem is the part that lets the programs connect to each other.</font>

148
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,270
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It looks like there's some kind of weird hole in the protocol.</font>

149
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,650
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">My buddies and I think that this may be the work of the Knights, too.</font>

150
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Knights...</font>

151
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,870
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain?</font>

152
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:08,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Looks like you and the Wired are getting along just fine now.</font>

153
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yeah.</font>

154
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,960
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Let me give you one little warning.</font>

155
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,170
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Huh?</font>

156
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">When it's all said and done, the Wired</font>

157
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">is just a medium for communication and the transfer of information.</font>

158
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,930
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You mustn't confuse it with the real world.</font>

159
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,190
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Do you understand what I'm warning you about?</font>

160
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're wrong.</font>

161
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Huh?</font>

162
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The border between the two isn't all that clear.</font>

163
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'll be able to enter it soon.</font>

164
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,220
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">In full range. Full motion. I'll translate myself into it.</font>

165
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Even with a top of the line civilian Navi, you couldn't...</font>

166
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I can do it. I've modified mine.</font>

167
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,600
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A Psyche processor, huh?</font>

168
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,610
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But...</font>

169
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,480
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Don't worry. I'm still me.</font>

170
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,030
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sometimes I wonder.</font>

171
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I waited for you for hours!</font>

172
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why? Why didn't you come?!</font>

173
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:03,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!</font>

174
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,880
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Damn you!</font>

175
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">This mail is a message of happiness!</font>

176
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">By receiving this, you'll be happier than anyone else!</font>

177
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,050
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">In other words, the Knights do not physically exist,</font>

178
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,760
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">but are rather a thought itself that occurs within the Wired.</font>

179
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,930
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">They can be thought of as a religion that is spreading through the Wired.</font>

180
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Would you go out with me?</font>

181
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,730
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If you already have a boyfriend, I apologize.</font>

182
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:43,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If you love him, I'll give up on you. But if...</font>

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Go away.</font>

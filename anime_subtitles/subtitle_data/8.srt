00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,340
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And you don't seem to understand</font>

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,540
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}A shame you seemed an honest man</font>

5
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:32,290
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And all the fears you hold so dear</font>

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,560
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}Will turn to whisper in your ear</font>

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,960
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And you know what they say might hurt you</font>

8
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,430
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}And you know that it means so much</font>

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,190
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And you don't even feel a thing</font>

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,850
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}I am falling, I am fading</font>

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,970
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}I have lost it all</font>

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:25,990
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning</font>

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,630
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}Help me to breathe</font>

14
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:33,840
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}I am hurting, I have lost it all</font>

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,380
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}I am losing</font>

16
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,580
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}Help me to breathe</font>

17
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Do you want to be hurt, too?</font>

18
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Do you want your heart to feel like it's being scraped with a rasp?</font>

19
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,870
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If you do, don't look away, whatever you do.</font>

20
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,210
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Nobody knows if there is or not.</font>

21
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:46,020
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It doesn't matter to the user if God exists in the Wired.</font>

22
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,640
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Just a second, Lain.</font>

23
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,990
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Let me take out this guy first.</font>

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,670
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's so fun about this? All you do is kill other players.</font>

25
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Nobody knows what's fun and why.</font>

26
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,920
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">"Tachibana General Laboratories" was written on the door plate.</font>

27
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,670
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A company as big as Tachibana General Labs wouldn't do anything illegal.</font>

28
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I've heard some rumors, though...</font>

29
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Rumors?</font>

30
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,740
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Do you know how we're able to exchange information in the Wired like this?</font>

31
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,980
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Oh, so you're testing me, huh?</font>

32
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're talking about the IP.</font>

33
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sorry. You're right.</font>

34
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">We aren't usually aware of the protocol's existence.</font>

35
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But the current 6th-gen protocol has reached its data throughput limit.</font>

36
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The 7th-gen protocol...</font>

37
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yes. The 7th-gen protocol.</font>

38
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,700
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Big companies are the ones that're making it into the new infrastructure.</font>

39
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,180
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">To control the protocol is to control the economy of the Wired.</font>

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I hear there's constant sabotage attempts going on.</font>

41
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,020
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">And the party behind it is...</font>

42
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,420
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Tachibana General Labs.</font>

43
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sis?</font>

44
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,330
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Mom? Dad?</font>

45
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,330
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I...</font>

46
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,800
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">A while ago, somebody asked me something.</font>

47
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,400
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">"Are you Iwakura Lain? Are your parents really your parents?"</font>

48
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Isn't that funny?</font>

49
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's funny, isn't it?</font>

50
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,640
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">People say the funniest things, huh?</font>

51
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,580
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Right?</font>

52
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Good morning!</font>

53
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu...</font>

54
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,740
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Good morning.</font>

55
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,870
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-What's wrong?</font>

56
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,020
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I don't believe it, but...</font>

57
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,750
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-What?</font>

58
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,820
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain, you didn't do it, right?</font>

59
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,730
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">D-Didn't do what?</font>

60
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">She's just playing innocent!</font>

61
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,930
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Reika! You don't know that!</font>

62
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,800
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain, seriously. It wasn't you?</font>

63
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,240
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What are you talking about?</font>

64
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain, in the Wired, did you...</font>

65
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,520
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No, forget about it. It couldn't have been you, Lain.</font>

66
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I trust you. Okay?</font>

67
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,510
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu!</font>

68
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,880
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu!</font>

69
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's too dangerous. Avoid approving any more bills.</font>

70
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,900
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I can't believe it! How can such a nice guy be into such weird stuff?</font>

71
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">There's an extremely serious bug in Protocol 6.</font>

72
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Damage caused by this may prove disastrous in the Wired.</font>

73
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Every night, a small, child-like person in a</font>

74
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,450
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">red and green striped sweater appears in her room.</font>

75
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,600
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">When she was in high school, that pop singer hit someone</font>

76
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">with her boyfriend's car and fled the scene!</font>

77
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,520
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's gotta be true! I heard it firsthand!</font>

78
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That building's a famous haunted spot.</font>

79
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If you look at a terminal at night,</font>

80
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">internal e-mail shows up, but there's nobody there!</font>

81
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,200
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Knights don't exist! Some American students started it as a joke!</font>

82
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,920
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Shut up! Who cares about any of that?</font>

83
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,370
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Don't you find it interesting?</font>

84
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,200
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who's there?</font>

85
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,840
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're looking for me, aren't you?</font>

86
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,520
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">So God makes His grand entrance, huh?</font>

87
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,150
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">How do you define "God"?</font>

88
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,510
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If it's the creator of the world, that's not me.</font>

89
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The all-powerful ruler of the world? You give God too much credit.</font>

90
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,560
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Where are you?</font>

91
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But if you define God as one who exists everywhere in that other world?</font>

92
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,600
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If that's what you mean, then yes. I suppose you could call me that.</font>

93
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I have only a slight influence on the workings of the world, however.</font>

94
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,380
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who the hell are you?!</font>

95
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,350
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I am you.</font>

96
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:58,750
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You must have realized that another you has always existed in the Wired.</font>

97
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You are merely a hologram of that other you.</font>

98
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,560
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You are just a body.</font>

99
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,730
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You expect me to believe that?</font>

100
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,800
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's impossible. It's crazy.</font>

101
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But you don't think that the you in the real world</font>

102
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,000
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">is the same as the one standing here in the Wired, do you?</font>

103
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,840
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But I'm me...</font>

00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,210
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">{\an8}Peeping Tom</font>

105
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,450

106
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,640
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu?</font>

107
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,490
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu? Where are you?</font>

108
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,190
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu?</font>

109
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu!</font>

110
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu! Where are you?</font>

111
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,950
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu!</font>

112
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu, where are you? Arisu!</font>

113
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,200
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What did I do?</font>

114
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,950
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What did I do in the Wired?</font>

115
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,230
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's the other me doing?</font>

116
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,400
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">{\an8}Don't worry about the rumors! Don't worry about it!</font>

117
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,770
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Is it all right for you to do this with a teacher?</font>

118
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,750
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">N-No, it's not...</font>

119
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,820
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why do it, then?</font>

120
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,710
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Because... I want to.</font>

121
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">"Hey, do you know who Mizuki Arisu likes?"</font>

122
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,990
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">"Do you know who she's thinking of when she plays with herself?"</font>

123
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It was you who told everyone! The rumors were true?!</font>

124
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,190
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain!</font>

125
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You've always been sitting there quietly, watching me?!</font>

126
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:49,370
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You saw what I didn't want anybody to know! When I didn't want anybody to see!</font>

127
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">And when I...</font>

128
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Tell me it isn't true, Lain!</font>

129
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,220
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain!</font>

130
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,880
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You...</font>

131
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,540
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who are you?</font>

132
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,150
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're not me.</font>

133
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'd never do what you do.</font>

134
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,380
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I...</font>

135
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,580
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Stop it! Why are you acting like the part of me that I hate?</font>

136
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,800
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You...</font>

137
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm committing suicide!</font>

138
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,020
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why? Why are you warm?</font>

139
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,520
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why do I have to feel your body heat?</font>

140
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,520
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, I'm Lain, aren't I?</font>

141
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No!</font>

142
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No!</font>

143
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What are these things?</font>

144
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">They're all you.</font>

145
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,010
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I said that you've always existed in the Wired, didn't I?</font>

146
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,740
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're the same as me.</font>

147
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're omnipresent in the Wired.</font>

148
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,850
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Wherever anyone is, wherever they go, you have always been there.</font>

149
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,560
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You've watched what they didn't want others to see.</font>

150
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,950
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You've told everyone about it, that's all.</font>

151
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It was the right thing to do.</font>

152
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Wired's information should be shared, shouldn't it?</font>

153
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,110
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Everything you say is a lie.</font>

154
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,320
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why is that?</font>

155
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,270
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu and the others said that they saw me in the Wired when I wasn't there.</font>

156
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,560
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">As long as I'm aware of myself,</font>

157
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,360
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">my true self is inside me!</font>

158
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're telling me that these dupes are me?</font>

159
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,320
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What a load of garbage!</font>

160
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,030
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I...</font>

161
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,110
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If I'm really what you say I am, then...</font>

162
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,780
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Then what, Lain?</font>

163
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:21,760
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Their memories of being seen by Lain... I could delete that information!</font>

164
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's true. Give it a try.</font>

165
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You were born with that kind of power.</font>

166
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,020
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Good morning!</font>

167
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,510
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain!</font>

168
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,660
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, Lain!</font>

169
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,180
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">They forgot?</font>

170
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">They really forgot?</font>

171
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,380
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lain!</font>

172
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,520
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">They did!</font>

173
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,610
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu!</font>

174
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,790
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-What?</font>

175
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu!</font>

176
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,330
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, I wanna go to Cyberia today!</font>

177
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,030
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">C'mon, let's go!</font>

178
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,800
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I second that!</font>

179
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Wow, this sure is unusual...</font>

180
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,010
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sure. We can get changed at my place again and go from there.</font>

181
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,840
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Great!</font>

182
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,890
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, what should I wear?</font>

183
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Stop it! I'm me!</font>

184
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,240
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm over here!</font>

185
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,140
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Come on, hurry up!</font>

186
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,960
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hey, wait for me!</font>

187
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,870
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's right! Lain is Lain, and I'm me.</font>

188
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,190
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hello, Navi.</font>

189
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Hello, Lain.</font>

190
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I... I'm me, right?</font>

191
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,980
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">There's no other me but me, right?</font>

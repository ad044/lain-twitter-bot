00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,540
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an9}A shame you seemed an honest man</font>

00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:32,290
<font face="Karma Suture" size="54">{\an7}And all the fears you hold so dear</font>

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,530
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm just watching.</font>

22
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,930

23
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,740
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Right. She's becoming less and less like me.</font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Huh? Who?</font>

26
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,360
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sis?</font>

29
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,790
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Right.</font>

30
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,270
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Fine, suit yourself.</font>

31
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,910
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I know.</font>

32
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The real world and the Wired are attached end to end.</font>

39
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Very well.</font>

40
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,530
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What game do you want to play this time?</font>

41
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Try some of this...</font>

42
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's right, you morons.</font>

43
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm better than you bozos!</font>

44
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,590
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The real world isn't real at all.</font>

46
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,400
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Are you okay?</font>

47
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,940
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why do you ask?</font>

48
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,940
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Lately, you've been... slipping again, Lain.</font>

49
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">We... We wanted to make you happy, so we've been taking you out with us.</font>

50
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,060
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's what we were trying to do. Honest.</font>

51
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,820
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But if you weren't happy, I apologize.</font>

52
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,840
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No! That's not it.</font>

53
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Of course I was having fun.</font>

54
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I've had a great time.</font>

55
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Glad to hear it.</font>

56
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Arisu!</font>

57
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yeah?</font>

58
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,830
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Um... Thanks. Thanks for worrying about me.</font>

59
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,570
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That's what friends are for, right?</font>

60
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,100
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">See you.</font>

82

83
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,830
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Her metamorphosis. Her will. Her power.</font>

107
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,940
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">No, I just...</font>

108
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Well, maybe a little.</font>

112
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,150

120
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,890
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If you come with us, we'll tell you.</font>

121
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,340
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I... I don't want to be here. You understand that, don't you?</font>

122
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,750
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Just look at all I can do! Look!</font>

123
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm breaking the barrier between the real world and the Wired.</font>

127
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,220
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I tracked you down all by myself!</font>

<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I've done everything I can on the app end of things.</font>

135
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,030
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I guess it's hopeless with an old machine like this.</font>

136
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But I've always used this thing...</font>

137
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,270
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I just can't work up the interest to switch over to a new Navi.</font>

138
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Not at my age.</font>

139
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If I were as young as you, though...</font>

140
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That jumper there.</font>

141
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,500
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Try removing this jumper and that one over there.</font>

142
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sorry, could you do it for me?</font>

143
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,520
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Authorized.</font>

144
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,660
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">L-Lain? You're one of the Knights?!</font>

145
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,310
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You are, aren't you, Lain? I had no idea!</font>

146
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,280
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Moron.</font>

147
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,170
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-Wait! Please!</font>

148
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,090
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">That game you've been playing with those kids lately is the greatest!</font>

149
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But I have an even better idea.</font>

150
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,290
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">So, please! Make me one of you! Make me a Knight!</font>

151
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Please, make me one of you!</font>

152
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:30,800
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Some say that the Wired doesn't have political borders like the real world.</font>

153
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,850
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But there are far too many</font>

154
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">nonsense-spouting anarchists or idiots who think that pranks are a revolution.</font>

155
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,430
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But the Knights don't seem to be either of those.</font>

156
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Knights...</font>

157
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,360
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm don't know how much of what you do is intentional.</font>

158
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,450
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Your presence in the Wired is highly unnatural.</font>

159
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,450
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">And the Knights seem to have a special interest in you.</font>

160
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:08,460
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I... I don't... I don't understand what you're...</font>

161
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,810
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">The Knights... You've been in direct contact with them at some point.</font>

162
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,920
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But I... I don't...</font>

163
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,970
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">At any rate, it looks like they want to use you for something.</font>

164
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,480
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">We believe that is something that must be prevented, no matter the cost.</font>

165
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,480
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-What... are you? Who are you?</font>

166
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,870
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Your secret's safe with me. You bet!</font>

167
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,180
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You believe in Deus, right? I'll follow your lead.</font>

168
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,260
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But is it true? Is God really in the Wired?</font>

169
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,360
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm not ready to believe that yet.</font>

170
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,700
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">But if you let me join you, I'll be able to learn more.</font>

171
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,460
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Then I'll believe!</font>

172
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,930
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Is that you?</font>

173
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,160
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You came!</font>

174
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,510
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You came for me!</font>

175
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">My name...</font>

176
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,250
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's meaningless to know my real name.</font>

177
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,330
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I, and those gentlemen there, have no name.</font>

178
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,950
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Tell me.</font>

179
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:37,630
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Iwakura Lain, are you and the Lain of the Wired one and the same?</font>

180
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,940
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who are you?</font>

181
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,700
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I... I'm...</font>

182
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,770
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Are your parents your real parents?</font>

183
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Huh?</font>

184
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,640
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Is your sister your real sister?</font>

185
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,150
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">W-What are you saying? O-Of course they are...</font>

186
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,150
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">When is your father's birthday?</font>

187
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,650
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Dad's... His...</font>

188
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:08,030
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What about your mother's birthday? When did your parents get married?</font>

189
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,660
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Did they meet, or was it arranged?</font>

190
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,460
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">T-That's... I...</font>

191
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,670
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Why don't you know? You never asked?</font>

192
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,410
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You've never celebrated a birthday in your family? Not since you were little?</font>

193
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,470
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Well?</font>

194
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,450
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">When were you born? Where?</font>

195
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,690
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I... What does it matter? It...</font>

196
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,330
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You don't know? You don't know anything?</font>

197
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,670
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Are you okay? You don't know anything.</font>

198
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,830
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Shut up, damn it...</font>

199
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,540
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Who cares about that crap? Like any of it matters...</font>

200
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,720
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You're Lain of the Wired?</font>

201
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,520
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">So what if I am?</font>

202
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,840
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">If you're here without a device, you know that the border between</font>

203
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,050
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">the real world and the Wired is starting to crumble, don't you?</font>

204
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,150
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">So?</font>

205
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,240
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">We believe that to be dangerous.</font>

206
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,930
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Sounds interesting.</font>

207
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,040
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Move it.</font>

208
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,860
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">What's the big idea?</font>

209
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,170
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You are what's dangerous.</font>

210
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,390
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Karl!</font>

211
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,370
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">It's as she said. Something interesting is beginning.</font>

212
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,440
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">We should just watch from the sidelines.</font>

213
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,620
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Shou!</font>

214
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,120
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Yeah, Mom?</font>

215
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,490
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Let me play, too!</font>

216
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,790
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Are you done with work?</font>

217
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,950
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">You bet!</font>

218
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,920
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm the greatest!</font>

219
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">I'm gonna get ya, Shou!</font>

220
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,300
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">See? Say your prayers!</font>

221
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,170
<font face="Open Sans Semibold" size="40">Watch this!</font>
